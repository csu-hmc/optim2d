Optimization on a muscle-driven 2D gait model

This repository contains Matlab code to do trajectory optimization on a 2D gait model.  The musculoskeletal dynamics can be augmented with prosthetic components (above knee, below knee), and the corresponding muscles can be amputated.

The first release of this package was delivered to the Cleveland Clinic in the fall of 2011 and was used by James Chien for this thesis work.

There is a lot of cleanup to do.

The gait2d model is included (see gait2d_reference.pdf), but not its source code.  We will eventually redo that model in a better way, but for now, consider it a black box that works.
